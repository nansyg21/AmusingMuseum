    <string name="exhibitsFall1">Oinochoe (ewer) of the 4th century made of pale green glass. The vessel is constructed with the technique of blowing (blown glass) in two consecutive molds </string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall2">Bronze oil lamp, dating to the 6th century, that was found in Louloudies of Kitros in Pieria. The hole, through which they use to fill it with the fuel (usually oil), has a clam-shaped cover. The tip of the wick came out of the second hole. The handle of the oil lamp is cross-shaped and at its back there is a carrying handle. In the centre of the cross there is a link chain, which resulted in another equivalent, in front of the clam-shaped cover, so that the lamp can be hung from above.</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall3">Clay whistle of the 3rd-4th century. Discovered in the eastern cemetery of Thessaloniki, north of the cemetery of Evangelistria. When the vessel was filled with water, the sound produced, when using the whistle, imitated a bird’s chirping. The sound was varied according to the height of the water level inside the vessel. The format of this game remained unchanged until nowadays, as similar whistles are sold as toys so far, especially at festivals of regions remote from urban centres</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall4">Wooden portable icon with Virgin dexiokratoussa, which is dated to around 1200. The Virgin Mary is depicted to the waist, praying with her left hand on the chest and keeping with the right hand the infant Christ. Christ blesses with the one hand, while he holds with the other a wrapped scroll (manuscript in the form of a scroll).</string>

    <string name="exhibitsFall7">Archiepiscopal vestment (sakkos) of Ioannikios, bishop of Melenikon. Silk embroidered with gold and silver threads. On the front side there are vine sprouts with grapes, which end in oval medallions, into which the apostles are depicted. The enthroned Christ Pantocrator and the Annunciation are depicted inside the large central frameworks. On the reverse side the family tree of Christ, known as the “Root of Jesse” is depicted. Work of Christopher Zefar. It is dated between 1745-1753.</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall8">Perperum of Manuel I Comnenus, which is dated to 1164-1167 from New Panteleimonas in Pieria. On one side, which is the curved one, Christ is depicted young in the type of Christ Emmanuel. He is framed by the inscription IC- XC (Jesus Christ) and around him there is the invocation “+Κύριε βοήθει”. On the reverse side, which is concave, Manuel I is depicted standing, with imperial attire, holding a banner and a crusader sphere. Up and right, in the background, there is the hand of God. On the right and on the left of the emperor we read “To Manuel Despot, the Porphyrogenitus”. Issued by the mint of Constantinople</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall9">Lead seal of emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus (913-959). On one side Christ Pantocrator with the initials IC-XC (Jesus Christ) is depicted. On the reverse side the emperor Constantine VII in bust, with imperial attire, and holding a crusader sphere in his right hand is depicted. We read the partly ruined inscription “+ Constantine”, written in circular form. This is the seal of the erudite emperor Constantine VII, son of Leo VI the Wise. The depiction of the emperor on this seal is an excellent example of a portrait of that era</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall10">Colored engraving, engraved and printed in 1798 by the monk painter Nikiforos, who came from the town of Karpenissi. Its central theme is St. George, the dragon-slayer and view of the Monastery of Xenophon, which is dedicated to this Saint. The representation is surrounded by secondary small icons in the corners• up and right Christ blessing the great martyr George, before He gives him the crown, and on the left St. Marina praying with a cross in her hand. On the bottom of the depiction we can see the Saint who hits the earth and water flows and his beheading</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall11">Opus sectile, placed on a wall. Dated to the second quarter of the 7th century it comes from the church of St. Demetrius in Thessaloniki. White and red marble tiles are placed on a background of a different color and form a panel of geometric character. Works of this type are a special kind of luxurious ornamentation, found in buildings of this era</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall12">Mural painting of the early 5th century from the west wall of a vaulted tomb, depicting the history of Sosanna from the Old Testament. Sosanna was accused of adultery by two Jewish judges, when she refused to give in to their solicitations. After that they both asked the death penalty for her. Sosanna prayed to God, Who sent Daniel to cross-examine the judges and reveal the plot. The theme of the representation was very popular at that time, because it expresses allegorically the triumph of the Church against the heresies which shook the Christian world in the 4th and 5th centuries.</string>
    <string name="exhibitsFall13">Relief slab of a pseudo sarcophagus from a Christian tomb of the 11th-12th century from Thessaloniki. We miss the left half of the slab.

The decoration includes two crosses on pedestals (the horizontal antennas of which have been destroyed, to be used for Jewish burial). The cross on the right is Latin and is surrounded by vines that grow from its base. An eagle on the right and a smaller bird on the left, pecking berries of grapes, step on the vine. The cross on the left is a Resurrection cross (with a double horizontal antenna) and a cypress grows from its base.
